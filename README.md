# CNN Image Classifier for Cats and Dogs

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifier for two classes: Cats and Dogs. The model was trained using a sequential model with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, and Flatten layers, optimized with the Adam optimizer. The performance of the model is evaluated using Precision, Recall, and Binary Accuracy metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized into a `data` directory with two subdirectories, one for each class.
